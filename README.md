# 🌌 Ozosphere

**The terminal is your playground.**  
Ozosphere is an Alpine-based, ultra-minimalist Linux distribution built for those who believe GUIs are overrated. It boots fast, runs lean, and gets out of your way so you can get work done — or just flex your CLI skills.

## 🧠 Why Ozosphere?

Ozosphere is for:

- Old machines that deserve better.
- People who think X11 is bloat.
- CLI power users who want full control.
- Anyone who wants a distraction-free environment.

There’s no desktop environment (unless you need it for temp use). No graphical package managers. No hand-holding. Just a clean terminal and preinstalled tools to let you hit the ground running.

## 🚀 Features

- **Alpine-based**: small, fast, and secure by default
- **No Desktop Environment (DE)**: multitasking is done via terminal tabs or TUI apps
- **Offline-first**: built to function without constant internet access
- **Preinstalled CLI essentials**: includes `neofetch`, `htop`, `nano`, `curl`, and more
- **Modular and hackable**: nothing’s locked down, everything’s yours to tinker with

## 🔧 System Requirements

| Component      | Minimum       | Recommended     |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| CPU           | 32-bit or 64-bit | 64-bit dual-core |
| RAM           | 256 MB        | 512 MB+         |
| Disk Space    | 1 GB          | 2 GB+           |
| Display       | Terminal      | Terminal        |

This is designed to *fly* on toaster-tier hardware.

## 📦 Included Tools

Some of the tools Ozosphere ships with (subject to change):

- `bash` or `ash`
- `tmux` – for multitasking in the terminal
- `htop` – process management
- `neofetch` – because flexing is fun
- `micro` or `nano` – simple terminal text editor
- `curl` and `wget` – for fetching stuff
- `git` – version control
- `XFCE` please only use if you need, meant for temporary use of graphical applications

No Python. No Node. No Rust. You want it? Install it.
